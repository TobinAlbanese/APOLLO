# **APOLLO**

# üåû APOLLO

**Augmented Profiling & Observation for Linked Learning & Orchestration**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

APOLLO is an intelligent graph-based platform for **mapping and analyzing complex relationships** between people, organizations, events, and locations. It uses machine learning to uncover hidden links, build dynamic intelligence networks, and provide deep insights to intelligence analysts and investigators.

---

## üéØ Vision & Goals

- **Dynamic Relationship Graphs:** Visualize evolving connections across multi-source data.  
- **Link Prediction:** Machine learning models infer missing or unknown relationships.  
- **Entity Profiling:** Aggregate attributes and activity histories into unified profiles.  
- **Network Analysis Tools:** Detect clusters, influencers, and anomalous patterns.  
- **Orchestration Workflows:** Automate data updates, alerts, and reporting based on graph changes.  
- **Open API:** Flexible integrations with external intelligence and case management systems.
